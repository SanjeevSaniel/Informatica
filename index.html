              What do you want? What are you chasing?<br />
              <blockquote>
                  If you are immediately thinking about what you don't want and can't
                  seem to have clarity to express what you want,
                  <br />
                  how will you know what you need to do to get what you want?
                  Confused? Well, this is why being aligned is important.

              What is it about being still... Why is it important? <br />
              <blockquote>
                  It is in moments of stillness that we absorb, we experience and we live.

          <p class="description">
              You know that feeling you get when you clean your cupboard or your office drawer? <br>
              
              <blockquote>
                There is an instant sense of order and clarity. <br>
                Simple because now, you can find exactly what you are looking for. <br>
                It's just the same with cleaning the emotional clutter in your mind.

          </h3>
          <p class="description">
              There is a constant sense of spewing and absorbing judgement. Wouldn't you agree? <br>
              <blockquote>
                  Whatever words you choose to judge yourself or others around you, <br>
                  it all comes down to - I am not good enough or she or he is not good enough. <br>
                  This mindset always leaves you with limiting beliefs.

          </h3>
          <p class="description">
              How do you react to any sort of chnages in your life? <br>
              Do you struggle or do you welcome it with open arms? <br>
              Is it hard for you to let go?
              <blockquote>
                  Maybe you should try looking at this way: this change can turn things around for you, <br> it can build you as a person. So embrace it!
